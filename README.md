## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on the *[Dataset Name]*. The purpose of this EDA is to gain insights into the data, identify patterns, and prepare the dataset for further modeling or analysis.

*Main objectives:*

- Understand the structure of the dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Visualize key variables and their relationships.
- Identify and handle missing data.
- Generate summary statistics.

## Dataset

- *Name:* cars.csv
- *Description:* A brief description of the dataset, including the number of observations and features.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip.

pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn 


## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA is divided into the following steps:

1. *Data Loading:* Loading the dataset and examining the basic structure.
2. *Data Cleaning:* Handling missing values, duplicates, and any data inconsistencies.
3. *Data Visualization:* Generating visualizations to explore the distribution of variables and relationships between them.
